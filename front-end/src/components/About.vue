      <p>Welcome to Vida Fit!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Vida Fit helps users track their health statistics, sleep patterns, and eating habits and 
        overall support them in achieving their health and fitness goals. Vida Fit was born
         out of a need to provide young adults with a helpful digital health tracking app. The core 
         functionality of the web application is allowing users to create and update their profile 
         pages which includes an exercise, diet, and sleep page. Users are able to log meals, sleeping 
         habits, and exercises they complete. Further, users are able to update and delete these logs 
         at any moment and can also make edits to their profiles.
